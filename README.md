<font color="#00BE87">**MyHbarWallet**</font> is a free, client-side
interface helping you interact with Hedera™ Hashgraph. Our easy-to-use,
open-source platform allows you to generate keys, create accounts,
transfer hbars, and so much more.

-   <img width="16" src="./src/assets/icon_nav_purple_keys.svg">&nbsp;&nbsp;**Self-sovereignty**._You_ have control over your wallet at all times. Private keys are never stored nor sent to servers. For even more control, a hardware wallet can be used
    to never expose your private key to the application.

-   <img width="16" src="./src/assets/icon_nav_purple_people.svg">&nbsp;&nbsp;**Offline**. There is no <font color="#00BE87">**MyHbarWallet**</font> server. The application runs entirely in _your_ browser. It can be run completely disconnected from [MyHbarWallet.com](https://MyHbarWallet.com). It can be run as a desktop application (powered by [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)).

-   <img width="16" src="./src/assets/icon_hedera.svg">&nbsp;&nbsp;**Hedera™ Hashgraph**. The first wallet (after the official mobile wallets) to exist and will continue to be at the lead in supporting new and exciting functionality on Hedera™ Hashgraph.

-   <img width="16" src="./src/assets/img_token_gen.svg">&nbsp;&nbsp;**Hedera™ Token Service (HTS)**. View the balance of _all_ your assets on Hedera™; transfer tokens (and hbar); and, purchase tokens through an exchange (when available).
